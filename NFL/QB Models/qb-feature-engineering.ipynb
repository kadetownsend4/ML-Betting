    "\n",
    "I made this file later on when I tried to revisit the ML process for the nfl. I created a new file for feature engineering based on the work that I had \n",
    "done on qb passing yards. I was thinking I should have a file that engineers the features and the files with the models simply read from it. I did not\n",
    "get to work with these features much but it gave me a starting point on how I might set up the procecss for the NFL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI-Usage** \n",
    "\n",
    "I utilized chat gpt to help me throughout this process. It gave me an outline of how to extract the features and target variables, intialize the models, and compute performance metrics to analyze the different models. After understanding how to perform this process for one model, I got help creating loops to loop through the different models and print out the performance metrics in an organized manner. Upon completing this portion of the machine learning process, it helped guide me towards understanding which features are most important and how to make predictions for a specfic player's passing yards. I provided more details towards how I engineered the code using prompts above their code blocks. \n",
